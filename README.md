Portfolio Submission: Pirate Intelligent Agent

Project Reflection

Work Done on the Project

For the pirate intelligent agent project, I was provided with a foundational framework that included the environment setup, basic game mechanics, and visualization tools. The provided code established the pirate game world with its states, actions, and reward structure.


I personally implemented the reinforcement learning components, specifically:


python

# Created the Q-learning algorithm implementation
def q_learning(env, num_episodes, alpha, gamma, epsilon):
    q_table = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n])
    for i in range(num_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            if random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
                action = env.action_space.sample()
            else:
                action = np.argmax(q_table[state])
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            old_value = q_table[state, action]
            next_max = np.max(q_table[next_state])
            new_value = (1 - alpha) * old_value + alpha * (reward + gamma * next_max)
            q_table[state, action] = new_value
            state = next_state
    return q_table

I also developed the neural network model using TensorFlow to create a deep Q-network (DQN) that could learn optimal policies through experience.

What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists solve complex problems through computational thinking and algorithm development. In this project specifically, I applied reinforcement learning principles to create an agent that learns from experienceâ€”a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence.

Computer science matters because it enables automation, optimization, and innovation across virtually all fields. The intelligent agent I developed demonstrates how machines can learn to make decisions in uncertain environments, which has applications ranging from robotics and autonomous vehicles to resource management and healthcare.

My Approach to Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
When approaching the pirate agent problem, I followed these steps:

Understand the problem domain - analyzing the grid environment, possible actions, and reward structure
Break down complex problems - separating the task into state representation, action selection, learning algorithm, and evaluation
Apply algorithmic thinking - implementing Q-learning with appropriate exploration-exploitation balance
Iterate and optimize - refining hyperparameters and network architecture based on performance metrics
Test and validate - ensuring the agent consistently finds optimal paths across different scenarios
This systematic approach is characteristic of computer science problem-solving, emphasizing abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithm design.

Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I recognize several ethical responsibilities:

Transparency - Documenting how the agent makes decisions and its limitations
Fairness - Ensuring the learning algorithm doesn't develop biases from training data
Safety - Building safeguards to prevent harmful actions in real-world applications
Efficiency - Optimizing resource usage to minimize environmental impact
Privacy - Protecting any user data that might be used in training or operation
Even in this simple project, these considerations are relevant. For example, if this agent were controlling actual resources or making recommendations, understanding its decision-making process would be crucial for users to trust and appropriately rely on the system.

The reinforcement learning techniques demonstrated in this project form the foundation for more complex AI systems where these ethical considerations become increasingly important.
